Task
Modify the task management application to allow users to edit the priority of existing tasks.

Add edit state to tasks
Subtask:
Modify the task objects in the tasks array to include an isEditing flag.

Reasoning: I need to modify the Vue application code to add the isEditing flag to task objects both when they are created and when they are loaded from local storage. This involves locating the relevant sections in the script tag and adding the new property.

Add edit button to task card
Subtask:
Add an "Edit" button to each task card in the HTML.

Reasoning: I need to add an "Edit" button to each task card in the HTML. I will locate the task card structure within the HTML, add a button with the text "Edit", bind a click event to call an editTask function, add appropriate Tailwind CSS classes, and use v-if to control its visibility based on the task.isEditing flag.

Implement edit mode in task card
Subtask:
When the "Edit" button is clicked, show input fields (including a priority dropdown) and "Save" and "Cancel" buttons within the task card.

Reasoning: I need to modify the HTML template to display input fields for editing when task.isEditing is true, following the instructions provided.

Update task data on save
Subtask:
Implement the saveTask function to update the task object in the tasks array with the new priority and other edited fields, then set isEditing back to false.

Reasoning: Implement the saveTask function to update the task object and exit editing mode.

Cancel editing
Subtask:
Implement the cancelEdit function to revert the task card to display mode and set isEditing back to false without saving changes.

Reasoning: Implement the cancelEdit function to revert the task card to display mode and set isEditing back to false without saving changes. This involves reverting the task's properties to their original values, deleting the original properties, and setting isEditing to false.

Update prioritization prompt (optional but recommended)
Subtask:
Consider if the AI prioritization prompt needs adjustment now that tasks can have manually set priorities. You might want the AI to respect the manually set priority or provide suggestions based on it.

Double-click (or enter) to edit

Reasoning: Review the current AI prioritization prompt and determine how to adjust it to consider the manually set priority. Modify the prompt within the prioritizeTasks function to instruct the AI to strongly consider the user's set priority while still taking into account other factors like category and due date.

Summary:
Data Analysis Key Findings
The task management application now includes an isEditing flag on each task object to manage the editing state.
Each task card in the application's HTML template has an "Edit" button that triggers the editing mode.
When a task is in editing mode, the task card displays input fields for title, description, due date, and a dropdown for priority, along with "Save" and "Cancel" buttons.
The saveTask function successfully updates the task data in the tasks array with the edited values and saves the changes to local storage.
The cancelEdit function correctly reverts any changes made during editing using stored original values and exits the editing mode without saving.
The AI prioritization prompt has been updated to consider the user's manually set priority as a primary factor, while still incorporating category and due date as secondary considerations.
Insights or Next Steps
The implementation of the editing feature enhances user control over task details, particularly priority, allowing for a more personalized task management experience.
The updated AI prioritization prompt represents a valuable step towards a hybrid prioritization system that respects user input while still leveraging AI for intelligent suggestions. Further refinement of the prompt and the AI's logic could explore more complex prioritization rules or user feedback mechanisms.
